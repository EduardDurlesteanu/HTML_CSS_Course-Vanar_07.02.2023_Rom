            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.

            <p>
            HTML elements are delineated by
            tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as "img "" and "input" directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as and surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
